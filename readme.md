## About
I initiated the development of "lobbies.us", a website designed to facilitate the posting of links to CS:GO lobbies, empowering users to connect with teammates who shared their commitment to the game. The platform aimed to alleviate the frustration of encountering low-level or uncommitted teammates.

As I navigated the development process, I encountered challenges, and the project underwent committed changes. Unfortunately, the site's utility was short-lived due to alterations in how Valve handled links. Despite its brief relevance, this project remains a valuable entry in my portfolio, reflecting my early foray into web development and problem-solving.

Kindly note that I was only 14 years old when I created this website, so I ask for your understanding as you review the committed changes. My journey into web development began at a young age, and this project serves as a testament to my early exploration of coding and problem-solving. Your consideration of my youthful perspective during the development process is appreciated.
